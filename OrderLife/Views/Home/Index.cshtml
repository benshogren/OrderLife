<h4>About</h4>
<h5>
    <p>
        The method is simple. If you are having a hard time keeping track of the details, the first step will be to get those details
        better ingrained in your mind. The overarching question is: what are all things I have to deal with? 
    </p>
    <p>
        To get your brain juices flowing 
        in that direction, you will be asked a series of small questions to which you will give small answers, which you will then write down.
        This is an age-old educational trick. The question will get you to think of the answer, and the writing will help you to remember it later. 
    </p>
    <p>
        These questions will all be along the lines of the larger categories of daily stuff in the 21st century life. By the end of the process you 
        will be able to hold in your (virtual) hand and in your mind a large chunk of the daily details you have trouble with. And having
        worked it out will have trained your mind how to do so in other areas of your life.
